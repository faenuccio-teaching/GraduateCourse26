# Graduate Course *Formalized Mathematics in Lean* for the *École Doctorale Info-Math de Lyon*, in Spring 2026.

## Lean and GitHub Prerequisites 

Before the beginning of the course, it would be important to:
* make sure that you have a working wifi when at ENS, usually via Eduroam.
* set-up a working `git` installation: for some help, you can have a look at <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/misc/git.html">this page maintained by Patrick Massot</a>.
* Create a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a> to be able later on to submit your work.
* install a working Lean environment following [the official instructions](https://lean-lang.org/install/): if this fails, don't worry, as we'll devote some time during the first class to fix issues.
* Clone the course repository on your laptop using the address: https://github.com/faenuccio-teaching/GraduateCourse26.git.
