# Welcome
This website contains many information about the Graduate Course *Formalized Mathematics in Lean* for the *École Doctorale Info-Math de Lyon*, in Spring 2026.

The teacher is [Filippo A. E. Nuccio](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/nf51454h/) and all material is in English: classes will be in French or in English according to participants.

For every lecture, there is a `.md` file (exported also as a `.pdf`), that you find below and that contains all material discussed in class; alongside these files, there is also a `.lean` file shown during class, whose solutions are posted the day following the lecture, in general.

The documentation for the Mathlib version used in this project is available [here](https://faenuccio-teaching.github.io/GraduateCourse26/docs/index.html).

## References

There aren't many books detailing how `Lean` works, but the beautiful
* [Mathematical Components](https://math-comp.github.io/mcb/), by A. Mahboubi and E. Tassi, tailored around the proof assistant [`Rocq`](https://rocq-prover.org/), is an excellent introduction to what formalization of mathematics is.

For everything concerning the "type theory" that we'll be using, a nice introduction is the first chapter "Type theory" of the
* [Homotopy Type Theory (a.k.a. "HoTT book")](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)

A more complete source, extremely well written and a really pleasant read is
* [Lectures on the Curry–Howard Isomorphism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/bookseries/studies-in-logic-and-the-foundations-of-mathematics/vol/149/suppl/C), by M. H. Sørensen et P. Urzyczyn.

 The two `Lean`-oriented references

also contain a lot of material relevant to our course.
